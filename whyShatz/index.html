      <h1>Proven Capital Market Experience</h1>
      <p>
        With over 15 years of experience, more than 100 transactions, and in
        excess of $7 billion in successful advisory and buy-side transactions,
        Shatz Capital boasts a track record that spans all commercial real
        estate (CRE) asset and transaction types. Our breadth of experience
        ensures sophisticated and knowledgeable handling of each deal, aligning
        with our clients' diverse needs.
      </p>
      <h1>Certainty of Execution</h1>
      <p>
        Shatz Capital partners exclusively with institutional-caliber capital
        partners, each with a proven closing track record. Our vast network
        includes national, regional, and local commercial and investment banks,
        private equity and debt funds, and government-sponsored entities. This
        expansive network is a testament to our ability to close with certainty.
      </p>
      <h1>Speed of Execution & Deep Relationships</h1>
      <p>
        Direct access to decision-makers is critical. Our enduring relationships
        with key personnel across our capital providers allow us to connect
        directly with principals and C-level executives, ensuring that every
        transaction is a priority from inception to close.
      </p>
      <h1>We Are Advisors, Not Brokers</h1>
      <p>
        Consider the Shatz Capital team as your comprehensive capital advisory
        firm. We're not just brokers; we're with you at every step, from initial
        underwriting to post-closing. Our involvement includes term sheet and
        loan document negotiation, coordination of 3rd party reporting, and
        regular updates to ensure a seamless closing process.
      </p>
      <h1>Targeted & Tailored Approach</h1>
      <p>
        Your deal is shown only to the most suitable set of capital partners,
        whose lending mandates align with your financing needs. Lenders know
        that a deal from Shatz Capital means a perfect fit for their platform,
        ensuring that your transaction receives focused attention and resources.
        This targeted method fosters a competitive market among the ideal
        lenders and ensures rapid, dedicated feedback without overexposing your
        deal.
